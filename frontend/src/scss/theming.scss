// NOTE: Sometimes there is a weird browser console warning saying something about theme not being loaded.
// This is a known bug with the current version of Angular Material2, and hopefully they will fix it soon.
// In the meantime...There are a couple of options to fix this if the warning really bugs you.
// Uncomment your option below

// NOTE: OPTION 1 - import a predefined angular theme. Kind of sucks if you really don't want any of the predefined themes.
// Recommended only if you plan on using one of the themes, otherwise it just adds weight to your css load
//@import '~@angular/material/prebuilt-themes/indigo-pink.css';

// NOTE: OPTION 2 - Looks like the check that triggers the console warning may be looking for this class.
// Recommended method - definitely much lighter for the css load;
// You need to uncomment 5 lines starting at the '@at-root'
@at-root {
    .mat-theme-loaded-marker {
