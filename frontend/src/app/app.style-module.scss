//* APPLICATION MODULE STYLE LOADER */
//*
//* NOTE: Why are there two different mixins?
//*
//* Structure mixins are included only once in app-core(),
//* whereas theme mixins get included as many times
//* as there are themes in the themeloop.
//* Primarily it is just to help reduce code duplication

// [ STEP 1 ] - IMPORT APPLICATION STYLE MODULE SCSS
@import 'navbar/navbar.style-module';

// [ STEP 2 ] - ADD MODULE'S BASE MIXINS (aka structure)
@mixin app-core() {
    @include navbar-module-core();
}

// [ STEP 3 ] - ADD MODULES'S THEME MIXINS (aka look-n-feel)
@mixin generate-app-theme ($theme-config) {
    @include navbar-module-theme($theme-config);
}
