//* SHARED COMPONENTS STYLE MODULE LOADER */
//*
//* NOTE: Why are there two different mixins?
//*
//* Structure mixins are included only once in app-core(),
//* whereas theme mixins get included as many times
//* as there are themes in the themeloop.
//* Primarily it is just to help reduce code duplication

// NOTE: First time only after creating this file,
// after you have completed the three steps below
// be sure to add this file to src/app/app.style-module.scss
// and follow the steps in that file

// [ STEP 1 ] - IMPORT MODULE COMPONENT SCSS FILES
// import your component scss
// example: @import './components/componentName/componentName.component.scss';

// components
@import 'components/search-metrics-dialog/search-metrics-dialog.component';
@import 'components/simple-time-picker/simple-time-picker.component';
@import 'components/theme-picker/theme-picker.component';

// widget common FIRST
@import 'components/widget-config.common';

// if individual widget-configs have custom style, include them

// [ STEP 2 ] - ADD COMPONENT'S BASE MIXINS (aka structure)
@mixin sharedcomponents-module-core() {
    // include your core mixins
    // example: @include componentName-component-core();
    @include search-metrics-dialog-component-base();
    @include simple-time-picker-component-base();
    @include theme-picker-component-base();

    // WIDGET CONFIG ITEMS
    @include widget-config-common-base();
}

// [ STEP 3 ] - ADD COMPONENT'S THEME MIXINS (aka look-n-feel)
@mixin sharedcomponents-module-theme($theme-config) {
    // include your theme mixins, passing along the $theme-config
    // example: @include componentName-component-theme($theme-config);
    @include search-metrics-dialog-component-theme($theme-config);
    @include simple-time-picker-component-theme($theme-config);
    @include theme-picker-component-theme($theme-config);

    // WIDGET CONFIG ITEMS
    @include widget-config-common-theme($theme-config);
}
